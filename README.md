UGDSB Timetable Mailer
======================

`timetable-mailer` takes a PDF of timetables generated by [Maplewood](http://www.maplewood.com/index.aspx),
and mails each student's timetable to their UGCloud address.

Requirements
------------
 - [PyPDF2](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2)
 - [Qt5](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) (for GUI only)
 - [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) (for GUI only)

Tested on Python 3.5

Getting Started
---------------
If you only want to run `timetable-mailer` on the command line, you do not need
to install Qt5 or PyQt5.

###Get Python3
Download and install the most recent [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
if it's not on your system already.

###Download and Install PyQt5 (optional)
_Qt5 must be installed before PyQt5_

Windows and OS X users should download and install Qt5 from
[the Qt website](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/). Then use pip to
download PyQt5 by typing  
`sudo python3 -m pip install PyQt5`.

### Install PyPDF2
Type the following into `terminal` or `cmd`:  
`sudo python3 -m pip install PyPDF2`

### Run It
Either edit the globals (words in captial letters near the beginning of the file) 
in `ttm.py`, or run `python3 gui.py` for a graphical user interface.
